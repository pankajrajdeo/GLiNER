A new method of HPLC using packing materials modified with a temperature responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PIPAAm), was developed. Homogeneous PIPAAm polymer and its copolymer with butyl methacrylate (BMA) were synthesized and grafted to aminopropyl silica by activated ester-amine coupling and they were used as packing materials. The surface properties and functions of the stationary phases are controlled by external temperature. Isocratic elution by aqueous mobile phase alone is the basis for separation of peptides and protein. The separation of the mixture of three peptides, insulin chain A and B and beta-endorphin fragment 1-27 was achieved by changing the column temperature with 0.9% NaCl aqueous solution as the sole eluent. Retention of peptides and proteins was controlled both by column temperature and by NaCl concentration in the aqueous mobile phases in this chromatographic system.\"\n",
